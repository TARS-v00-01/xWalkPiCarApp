# xWalk repository instructions

## Required project knowledge

Before analyzing, editing, reviewing, or generating code in this repository,
read and follow both knowledge-base documents:

- [`.agents/gudlines/CODING_GUIDELINES.md`](.agents/gudlines/CODING_GUIDELINES.md)
- [`.agents/gudlines/DOCUMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md`](.agents/gudlines/DOCUMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md)

Treat these files as the coding, architecture, and documentation knowledge base
for the complete `MyPiCarX` workspace, including `xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkLibrary/common`, `xWalkHal`,
`xWalkDriver`, and `xWalkController`.

Apply the guide to every future implementation. Preserve intentional existing
architecture, naming, dependency boundaries, validation behavior, test safety,
and CMake patterns unless the user explicitly requests a change.

After an implementation, compare the result with the guide. If the work
deliberately introduces or changes a reusable project-wide convention, update
the guide in the same change. Do not update it for a local exception, generated
output, accidental inconsistency, or unapproved redesign.

## Mandatory C++ formatting

Apply these rules to `.cpp`, `.cc`, `.cxx`, `.h`, `.hpp`, and `.hxx` files:

- use four spaces for every indentation level and never use tabs;
- indent nested namespaces, types, functions, methods, conditions, loops,
  switches, and all other blocks;
- indent `public:`, `protected:`, and `private:` inside their class, then indent
  declarations four additional spaces below the access specifier;
- use Allman braces, with every opening brace on the next line aligned with its
  block declaration and every closing brace aligned with its opening brace;
- always use braces for control-flow and other blocks, including a block whose
  body contains only one statement; and
- keep every C++ source or header line at or below 120 characters, wrapping
  declarations, calls, conditions, expressions, strings, and comments with
  continued indentation when necessary.

Use the repository-root `.clang-format` for mechanical formatting. Do not
format generated sources under an `auto-gen` or `generated` directory, and do
not reformat vendored or third-party code, including dependency-prefix headers
below `xWalkLibrary/x86_64` and `xWalkLibrary/aarch64`.

Before completing any C++ change, format all project-owned C++ files with:

```bash
xWalk-rpi5-tool/py-agent/dev-tool/styler-tool/xWalkStyler format
```

Before submitting or merging a change, validate formatting without modifying
the checkout:

```bash
xWalk-rpi5-tool/py-agent/dev-tool/styler-tool/xWalkStyler check
```

## Header-owned type definitions

Define every project class and structure in a header. Do not define a `class`
or `struct` in a `.cpp`, `.cc`, or `.cxx` file. Source files may contain
member-function implementations and ordinary object declarations such as
`struct stat pathStatus`, but they must not own a type definition.

Place public and reusable types in the owning component's `include` directory.
For an implementation-private type, use a narrowly scoped companion type
header with a named namespace; do not use an anonymous namespace in a header.
The repository-wide test-support layout below takes precedence for test fake
state, fixtures, mappings, callbacks, and factories.

## Repository-wide test support layout

For tests in `xWalkHal`, `xWalkDriver`, and `xWalkController`, move reusable
callback state, fake-backend structures, mapping records, callback declarations,
and callback-table factories into a dedicated `<Component>TestSupport.h` under
the owning test `include` directory. Put non-trivial implementations in the
matching `<Component>TestSupport.cpp` under the test `src` directory, and list
that source explicitly in every standalone or aggregate target that uses it.

Use a named, component-specific test namespace such as
`xwalk::hal::test::gpio`; never declare an anonymous namespace in a header,
because it creates different entities in every translation unit. Apply this
layout whenever test code is added or modified anywhere in the repository.

## Markdown command formatting

In `.md` files only, keep every fenced shell-command example on one physical
line. Do not use continuation backslashes to wrap CMake, build, test, Python,
or other shell commands. A complete shell-command line may exceed the normal
115-character documentation limit.

## Verification safety

Prefer host tests. Hardware tests are opt-in and must not be run unless the user
explicitly requests them and confirms that the correct Raspberry Pi and Robot
HAT setup is connected and safe.

## Gerrit-only publication

Never push component changes directly to GitHub. Commit them in their
independent component repository and upload them only to Gerrit `master` with:

```bash
git push origin HEAD:refs/for/master
```

An active upload triggers Gerrit CI automatically. To defer CI, upload the
change as WIP:

```bash
git push origin HEAD:refs/for/master%wip
```

For a WIP change, Gerrit's **Mark As Active** button is the Activate action.
Clearing WIP through that button triggers CI for the current patch set. Moving
an active change into WIP must not trigger CI.

GitHub hosts `xWalkPiCarAI/master` and private component repositories for recursive cloning.
Use explicit `https://github.com/TARS-v00-01/<component>.git` submodule URLs and permit GitHub fetch remotes.
Every integrated gitlink must be available in its GitHub component repository before publishing the integration.
Gerrit remains the source review and submission authority; GitHub fetch access does not authorize direct pushes.
After
an integration change passes complete CI, receives approval, and is submitted
to the configured Gerrit integration branch, the dedicated synchronization
service may fast-forward that exact submitted commit to the matching GitHub
branch. Do not use a direct, force, mirror, wildcard, or component GitHub push
as a preliminary, backup, or alternate publication path.
